# LangDAG

> LLM Conversations as Directed Acyclic Graphs

LangDAG is a high-performance Go tool for orchestrating LLM interactions. It models conversations and workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enabling branching, forking, and replaying of AI conversations.

## Key Features

- Two modes: Workflow (YAML pipelines) and Conversation (dynamic chat)
- Native streaming via SSE and WebSocket
- Conversation forking: branch from any node to explore alternatives
- Tool integration with Auto, Interrupt, and WebSocket execution modes
- Persistent storage: SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL
- ~1ms overhead, single static binary, zero runtime dependencies

## SDKs

- Python: `pip install langdag`
- Go: `go get github.com/langdag/langdag-go`
- TypeScript: `npm install langdag`
